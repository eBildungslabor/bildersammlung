# Elephas

__How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time__

Web browser based slideshow editor and presenter. Designed for math and science educators fluent in latex and html.
A complete rewrite of the previous php-based Wb.  Most of the work is now done client-side instead of on the server.  

Users may edit slides using the embedded Ace Editor.
