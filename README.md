# Elephas

__How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.__

* Web browser based slideshow editor and presenter.  Faciliates the presentation of sequential steps (common in the derivation of mathematical facts) in a collapsible sequence.

* Designed for math and science educators fluent in latex and html.

(This is a complete rewrite of the previous php-based Wb.  Most of the work is now done client-side instead of on the server.  
Users may edit slides using the embedded Ace Editor.)
